"""The local end-to-end tier: every test that needs this workstation rather than a runner.

devkit's nightly `devkit-local-e2e` job runs this in the checkout, and
`.claude/rules/local-e2e.md` is the contract: exit 0 green, anything else red, each failing
test printed as pytest's `FAILED <id>` line. What it runs is every test marked `local`,
which `addopts` in `pyproject.toml` deselects from every other run, CI's included.

**What is in the tier, and why it is here.** The GPU half of a frame is invisible to `tsc`
and to Vitest (`CLAUDE.md`, *Testing*): a shader that fails to compile, a pass sampling
the wrong texture, a module that throws on load all type-check and pass every unit test,
then show a black canvas. CI has no browser, so `tests/test_browser_e2e.py` builds the
site, serves it, and loads it in this machine's Chrome, headless: both skins must draw a
picture with nothing thrown, every asset in the lab must render, and the tree lab's GPU
volumes must match the CPU's pixel for pixel. Its driver is `tests/headless_chrome.py`.

**What it needs, and does not install:** Chrome (or Edge; `CHROME` names another) and
this checkout's `node_modules`. It does not run `npm ci`, because a worktree's
`node_modules` is a link to the primary checkout's and a reinstall would rebuild that one
under whoever is using it. A missing one fails the test that needs it, by name.

**A skip is a failure when the scheduler runs it** (`DEVKIT_E2E` set): the checkout is the
one the tests were written for, so nothing has a reason left to skip, and each skip is
printed as a `FAILED` line naming its reason. By hand the skips are listed and do not fail
the run.

**A run that executed nothing is red**, whoever ran it: a green from zero tests is a skip
reported as a pass.

**Test ids on the command line run those alone, still inside the tier**, which is how a
fixer reproduces one `FAILED` line:
`python scripts/e2e.py "tests/test_browser_e2e.py::test_game_draws[pixel]"`

pytest runs under the checkout's `.venv` where it has one, and this script stays
stdlib-only so the machine's Python can start it. `logs/e2e-junit.xml` is the artifact,
overwritten per run, on failure too.

Tested in `tests/test_e2e.py`.
