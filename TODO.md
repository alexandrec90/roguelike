# TODO — Roguelike

Freshly generated. These are the things the template deliberately left for you,
because guessing them wrong is worse than leaving them blank.

## Setup

- [ ] Fill in `.env` from `.env.example` (it is gitignored; nothing works without it)
- [ ] Confirm `python scripts/sync-devkit.py --list` shows a stamped `DEVKIT_VERSION`
- [ ] Set `DEVKIT_DIR` in CI so the drift check actually gates — a
      `--check` that prints "nothing to do (skipping)" is checking nothing
      (once `DEVKIT_VERSION` is stamped it fails instead of skipping; to check
      drift on a machine with no devkit clone, `pre-commit run devkit-drift`)

## First real work

- [ ] Replace the placeholder in `roguelike/` with something that does the job
- [ ] Delete `tests/test_smoke.py` once real tests exist
